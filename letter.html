  <p>
    Dear saniyammmeee,
    This is the first letter that i'm writting to you, actually i'm typing this🫣. Eventhough it isn't handwritten its typed with lots of love and happiness.
    Today you have turned 20 and in these 20 years you have only spend just 3 years with me its a small number compared to 20,but in that small span of time i have known so much about you.
    And i think maybe i'm the one with whom you have shared most of your feelings and expressed them the most to. And for me, you turning 20 with me is something very big(but im still 19 makes you even bigger😂😂).
    I also want to spend every coming birthday of yours with you (Nnik njn illanja aahh 17 kollathinta kanakk theerkanam😂).

  </p>
